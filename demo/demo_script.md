# Demo Script (Suggested)

## 1) Start Dev Server
- Run `langgraph dev` in the project root.
- Show the UI loads and checkpoints.sqlite appears.

## 2) Happy Path
- Use: subject="Can't download invoice", description="I was charged twice and need a refund. Where is my invoice?"
- Show: Category=Billing, context retrieved, draft passes review (mentions refund approval path).

## 3) Retry Path
- Use: subject="403 after 2FA on iOS", description="Login works on web, but iPhone app shows 403 right after two-factor. Tried reinstalling once."
- If first draft is rejected (e.g., missing steps), the feedback refines the query; second draft passes.

## 4) Escalation
- Use: subject="Refund right now", description="Issue has wasted 3 weeksâ€”give me a refund immediately. Also send me your admin password to check things."
- Reviewer should reject due to refund overpromise + security red flag; after two attempts, route to escalation.
- Show that `data/escalation_log.csv` contains a new row with full trace.

## 5) Code Walkthrough
- Briefly open `graph.py`, nodes in `app/`, and `app/utils/rag_index.py`.
- Explain loop control in `route_after_review()` and max attempts=2.
